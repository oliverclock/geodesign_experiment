# UNSW Geodesign Workshop Projects


## Step 1 
## Groups create individual .geojson files for project themes, i.e. 

### Transport
### Housing
### ...

### Groups save files onto this GitHub using their group as prefix, i.e. A_1_Housing.geojson
## Cloud script can be run to combine all letters together, i.e. A_1_All.geojson will contain all projects for Group A

## Step 2 
### Group works are combined into singular files based on workshop
### Cloud script combines multiple groups / tags together
## For example, groups A B and C in one file is i.e. ABC_1_All.geojson
## For example, all housing will be ABC_1_Housing.geojson

## Step 3 
### All groups download the decided file for next stage and save as:
## A_2_Housing.geojson

## ... and so on!
